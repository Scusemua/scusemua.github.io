title: "λFS: Elastically Scaling Distributed File System Metadata Service using Serverless Functions"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-LFS-ASPLOS
excerpt: 'The metadata service (MDS) sits on the critical path for file system operations, and as such it is key to the overall performance of a large-scale distributed file system (DFS). Common "serverful" MDS architectures, such as a single server or cluster of servers, have a significant shortcoming: either they are not scalable, or they make it difficult to achieve an optimal balance of performance, resource utilization, and cost. A modern MDS requires a novel architecture that addresses this shortcoming.

To this end, we design and implement λFS, an elastic, high-performance metadata service for large-scale distributed file systems. λFS scales a DFS metadata cache on a FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) platform and synthesizes a series of techniques to overcome the obstacles that are encountered when building large stateful applications on FaaS platforms. λFS takes full advantage of the unique benefits offered by FaaS--elastic scaling and massive parallelism--to realize a highly-optimized metadata service capable of sustaining up to 4.13× higher throughput, 90.40% lower latency, 85.99% lower cost, and better resource utilization and efficiency than a state-of-the-art DFS for an industrial workload.'
