# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my work, experience, and research as a Computer Science PhD student at George Mason University, specializing in cloud and serverless computing.

## 🌐 Project Overview

This website serves as an interactive portfolio where I display my research, skills, and personal projects. It aims to provide a seamless user experience through a modern UI and smooth navigation.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **UI Library**: [Material UI](https://mui.com/) - A popular React UI framework that provides pre-designed components.
- **Backend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - A React framework that offers server-side rendering and static site generation.

## 🚀 Features

- **Project Showcase**: Highlights select projects, with detailed descriptions and links to GitHub repositories.
- **Research**: Insights and summaries of my research in cloud and serverless computing.
- **Academic and Employment History**: Highlights of key points in my academic and CS career thus far.
- **Awards and Skills**: Overview of my CS-related skills and the CS-related awards that I've received.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for viewing on a range of devices, including both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Thanks to Material UI, the design is intuitive and easy to navigate.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a 3rd year PhD candidate in CS at George Mason University. My advisors are Dr. Yue Cheng (University of Virginia) and Dr. Songqing Chen (GMU). My research interests are centered around cloud computing with a focus on serverless computing. Specifically, I'm interested in applications of serverless computing to data analytics/data science, machine learning, file systems, and other areas.
